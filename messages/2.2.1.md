MayaSublime 2.2.1 change log:

- Add option "strip_sending_comments" with a default value of true, controlling whether single-line comments from selected source code is stripped before sending code selections to Maya. Sending whole files (nothing selected) always sends executed all content. This was existing behavior to reduce the amount of data being sent to the commandPort, but can lead to incorrect line numbers when errors are reported in Maya. So you can disable it if you are having trouble debugging with what Maya reports.
